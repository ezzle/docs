This is called System-Level Analysis.
Credible analytics are based on standards, backed by Industry Leaders.
CAST analytics are based on engineering standards set forth by a consortium of the industryâ€™s best minds: SEI, OMG and CISQ. Proven and standardized measures create consensus, serve as irrefutable benchmarks and lead to fact-based dialogue.
Analytics must scale across technologies and organizations.
Finding security issues in complex business systems, or improving development team throughput, or controlling global outsourcing contracts is not easy. Deploying and supporting analysis that helps companies do these things is not trivial either. CAST supports enterprise-grade analytics programs across hundreds of systems, and CAST Professional Services has deep-rooted expertise in ensuring success in even the most diverse enterprise measurement programs.
