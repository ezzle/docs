Enterprise architectuur tool
Initially starting as a purely open source EA tool, Essential has grown to be an EA tool for organisations of all sizes, where it is used as an interactive tool for visualising, traversing and diving into your enterprise architecture. Essential now has variants to support both those interested in a commercially supported enterprise architecture platform, as well as those who want to manage their architecture using open source technology.
