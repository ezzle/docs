This should be used to group separate version instances of a Technology Product into a family for that Product. e.g. WebLogic to group WebLogic 7.0, WebLogic 8.0, WebLogic 9.0.
This provides a more powerful and flexible approach than using Enumerations or Taxonomies.
Each version instance can be related in terms of the supersession of versions using the supersedes_version slot. e.g. ProductX 2.0 supersedes ProductX 1.5"}, ]}]
