Forensic Toolkit, or FTK, is a computer forensics software made by AccessData. It scans a hard drive looking for various information. It can, for example, locate deleted emails and scan a disk for text strings to use them as a password dictionary to crack encryption.

The toolkit also includes a standalone disk imaging program called FTK Imager. The FTK Imager is a simple but concise tool. It saves an image of a hard disk in one file or in segments that may be later on reconstructed. It calculates MD5 hash values and confirms the integrity of the data before closing the files. The result is an image file(s) that can be saved in several formats, including DD raw.
